## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve ui`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)

# Weather Dashboard Angular Exercise üå§Ô∏è‚õÖüå¶Ô∏è

Welcome to our Weather Dashboard Angular exercise! üéâ

This take-home exercise is designed to assess your skills in building an Angular application with a focus on creating an engaging user interface.
Please carefully read the instructions below and complete the exercise to the best of your ability.

## Objective

Build a Weather Dashboard Angular application without using any UI library.

## Requirements
1. Use the latest version of Angular.
2. Integrate with a weather API of your choice to fetch weather data.
3. Display the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and other relevant information for a selected location.
4. Implement a feature to search for weather information in different locations and display the results.
5. Make the user interface visually appealing and engaging using only custom CSS styles. Consider using animations, transitions, and other creative techniques.
6. Make the application responsive and ensure it looks great on different screen sizes.
7. Implement error handling for API failures or any other relevant errors, displaying error messages.
8. Provide unit tests for critical components or functionality.

## Instructions

1. Choose and integrate with a weather API of your choice. Make sure to read and understand its documentation for making API requests and handling responses.
2. Design the user interface creatively using custom CSS styles to provide an enjoyable weather exploration experience. Focus on creating visually appealing elements, animations, and transitions.
3. Implement the search functionality, allowing users to enter a location and fetch the weather information for that location from the API.
4. Display the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and any other relevant information for the selected location.
5. Implement error handling for cases where the API request fails or returns an unexpected response. Display appropriate error messages to the user.
6. Make the application responsive and ensure it looks great on different screen sizes.
7. Include unit tests to cover critical components or functionality. Focus on testing components that handle API requests, data manipulation, or user interactions.

**Bonus Challenge (Optional) üé®‚ú®:** If you want to go the extra mile and impress us, feel free to add your own creative touch! Showcase your unique ideas, such as additional weather data, interactive elements, personalized themes, or any other features you think would enhance the user experience. This is an opportunity to demonstrate your creativity and showcase your skills. However, please note that completing the core requirements is the primary focus, and any bonus additions should not compromise the functionality or usability of the application.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Code organization and structure**: Assess the overall structure of the codebase, including the separation of concerns, modularization, and adherence to best practices.
2. **Angular proficiency**: Evaluate the proper usage of Angular components, services, routing, and other relevant features.
3. **API integration**: Assess the ability to retrieve data from the API and handle the response effectively, including error handling.
4. **User interface**: Evaluate the design and usability of the application, including responsiveness and attention to detail.
5. **Testing**: Review the quality and coverage of unit tests to ensure critical components or functionality are appropriately tested.
6. **Overall code quality**: Assess the readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards.

Please submit your completed code in a GitHub repository.
Include clear instructions on how to run the application and any additional comments you may have.
Make sure you grant access to darondel@yoobic.com and emontredon@yoobic.com.

Thank you for participating, and we look forward to reviewing your submission! üôå
