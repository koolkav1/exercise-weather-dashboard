# Weather Dashboard Angular Exercise üå§Ô∏è‚õÖüå¶Ô∏è

Welcome to our Weather Dashboard Angular exercise! üéâ

This take-home exercise is designed to assess your skills in building an Angular application with a focus on creating an engaging user interface.
Please carefully read the instructions below and complete the exercise to the best of your ability.

## Objective

Build a Weather Dashboard Angular application without using any UI library.

## Requirements
1. Use the latest version of Angular.
2. Integrate with a weather API of your choice to fetch weather data.
3. Display the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and other relevant information for a selected location.
4. Implement a feature to search for weather information in different locations and display the results.
5. Make the user interface visually appealing and engaging using only custom CSS styles. Consider using animations, transitions, and other creative techniques.
6. Make the application responsive and ensure it looks great on different screen sizes.
7. Implement error handling for API failures or any other relevant errors, displaying error messages.
8. Provide unit tests for critical components or functionality.

## Instructions

1. Choose and integrate with a weather API of your choice. Make sure to read and understand its documentation for making API requests and handling responses.
2. Design the user interface creatively using custom CSS styles to provide an enjoyable weather exploration experience. Focus on creating visually appealing elements, animations, and transitions.
3. Implement the search functionality, allowing users to enter a location and fetch the weather information for that location from the API.
4. Display the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and any other relevant information for the selected location.
5. Implement error handling for cases where the API request fails or returns an unexpected response. Display appropriate error messages to the user.
6. Make the application responsive and ensure it looks great on different screen sizes.
7. Include unit tests to cover critical components or functionality. Focus on testing components that handle API requests, data manipulation, or user interactions.

**Bonus Challenge (Optional) üé®‚ú®:** If you want to go the extra mile and impress us, feel free to add your own creative touch! Showcase your unique ideas, such as additional weather data, interactive elements, personalized themes, or any other features you think would enhance the user experience. This is an opportunity to demonstrate your creativity and showcase your skills. However, please note that completing the core requirements is the primary focus, and any bonus additions should not compromise the functionality or usability of the application.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Code organization and structure**: Assess the overall structure of the codebase, including the separation of concerns, modularization, and adherence to best practices.
